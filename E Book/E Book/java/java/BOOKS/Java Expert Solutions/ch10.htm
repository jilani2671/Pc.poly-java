This chapter deals with the communication between applets running
within the same browser. It does not address the problem of sending
information between applets running in separate browsers. The
two problems are completely different. When two applets are in
the same browser, they can communicate using any form of inter-object
communication, including direct method calls. Communication between
applets in different browsers requires some form of networking
and usually an intermediate server. One common form of network
communication is Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which is discussed
in <A HREF="ch16.htm" >Chapter 16</A>, &quot;Creating 3-Tier Distributed Applications
with RMI.&quot;

You will occasionally need to allow two or more applets on a Web
page to communicate with each other. Because the applets all run
within the same Java context-that is, they are all in the same
virtual machine together-applets can invoke each other's methods.
The one tricky part is getting the applets in touch with each
other. The <TT>AppletContext</TT>
class has methods for locating another applet by name, or retrieving
all the applets in the current runtime environment. Listing 10.1
shows an applet that examines all the applets in the runtime environment
and displays them in a scrolling list.

Be prepared to check for an applet again if you can't find it the first time. Your browser may not load applets all at once, or you might dynamically load an applet. You may receive a <TT>NullPointerException</TT> if you try to get an applet that doesn't 
exist-be prepared to catch it. You may have difficulty distinguishing when an applet hasn't been loaded yet from error situations in which it can't be loaded. Try picking a maximum amount of time you'll wait for an applet to be loaded, and then assume that 

there's a problem if the applet you want hasn't been loaded after that time.

If you already know the name of the applet you want to access,
you can locate it with the <TT>getApplet</TT>
method. The following code fragment locates an applet named <TT>findme</TT>:

Applet findme = getAppletContext().getApplet(&quot;findme&quot;);
if (findme != null) {
// do something with findme
}

You might think that the applet name you use in <TT>getApplet</TT>
is the class name of the applet. This is not the case. You set
the applet's name in your <TT>&lt;APPLET&gt;</TT>
HTML tag. For example, here is the <TT>&lt;APPLET&gt;</TT>
tag for an applet class called <TT>FindMe</TT>,
which has an applet name of <TT>findme</TT>:

Only use lowercase names for applets. Some versions of Netscape convert the applet name to lowercase. The name of the applet is separate from the name of the applet's class, so you can still use uppercase letters in the class name.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Once two applets have located each other, their means of communication
is the same as for any two objects in the system. This means they
can invoke each other's methods, share common arrays between them,
or send data over stream pipes.
<P>
A stream pipe is a pair of streams: One is an input stream; the
other is an output stream. Any data written to the input stream
can be read from the output stream it is connected to. You can
use this mechanism to pass data between two applets or any two
objects in the system. One object creates both a <TT>PipedInputStream</TT>
and a <TT>PipedOutputStream</TT> class,
and then passes one end of the pipe to the other object. Whichever
object has the output end of the pipe can then start writing to
the pipe, while the object that has the input side can start reading.

Since stream pipes are subclasses of <TT>FileInputStream</TT> and <TT>FileOutputStream</TT>, you can use the existing stream filters to pass different kinds of data. The <TT>DataInputStream</TT> and <TT>DataOutputStream</TT> classes are good for passing 
simple data types over pipes, while the <TT>ObjectInputStream</TT> and <TT>ObjectOutputStream</TT> are excellent for passing whole objects.

Stream pipes are useful for doing sequenced messaging between
objects. Sometimes one object needs to tell another object to
perform several tasks in sequence. If some of the tasks take a
long time, you don't want the requesting object to have to wait
for all the tasks to be performed, yet you want to ensure that
they are done in the proper sequence. If the requests are made
by sending messages over a stream pipe, the sequencing problem
is solved, as is the waiting problem. The requesting object can
write all its requests to the <TT>PipedOutputStream</TT>
and continue on. The object performing the tasks reads each message
from its <TT>PipedInputStream</TT>,
performs the requested task, and then reads the next message from
the pipe. The messages are guaranteed to be read in the same sequence
they were written.
<P>
Listing 10.2 shows an applet that creates a stream pipe and passes
one end of the pipe to another applet. It demonstrates how to
create a pipe and how to wait for an applet to appear. The <TT>SenderApplet</TT>
first looks for its companion applet-<TT>ReaderApplet</TT>.
Since the sender may be loaded before the reader, it must retry
the search if it can't find the reader the first time it checks.
It tries once every second for 30 seconds before deciding that
the reader isn't going to be loaded.
<P>
Once the sender finds the reader, it passes one end of the stream
pipe to the reader through a simple method call. If you find that
you frequently need to pass stream pipes this way, you should
define an interface line this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
public interface StreamPipeClient
{
	public void setInputStream(InputStream);
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This frees the sender from having to know the exact class name
of the reader. As you can see in Listing 10.2, the sender knows
that the reader is an instance of <TT>ReaderApplet</TT>.

Listing 10.3 shows the reader portion of the pipe demonstration.
The sender applet had to perform a loop to wait for the reader
to become active. The reader has a similar problem-it has to wait
for the sender to give it the input end of the pipe. It looks
at the input stream once every second, and once the input stream
is no longer null, it starts reading data.<BR>

Rather than continually polling to see when the input stream is no longer <TT>null</TT>, the reader could use the wait/notify mechanism. Basically, if the input stream is <TT>null</TT>, the <TT>run</TT> method calls <TT>wait,</TT>which puts its thread to 
sleep. Then, the <TT>setInputStream</TT> method could call <TT>notify</TT> to wake the <TT>run</TT> method back up so it can start reading again.

One of the problems you occasionally run into when doing inter-process
communication with streams is that sometimes you need to send
the same message to a number of clients. It would be nice if you
had a stream that would write a message to a set of streams rather
than making you do multiple writes. All you need to do is create
an output stream that keeps track of the output streams it needs
to copy data to, and then create a write method that writes the
same byte to every connected stream.
<P>
Listing 10.4 shows a <TT>MultiClientOutputStream</TT>
class that enables you to connect up multiple output streams to
a single output stream. Whenever you write to it, it copies the
data you write to every stream that has been connected.

<P>
If you want to do inter-applet communications, you can take advantage
of the fact that because all the applets run in the same instance
of the virtual machine, all static class variables are shared
between applets. This means you can implement singleton classes
that are shared by all the applets. As you recall from Chapter
9, a singleton is a class that has only one unique instance. Its
constructor is hidden so classes cannot create new instances.
You access the one instance of the class through a static method
in the class such as <TT>instance()</TT>.
You can create a singleton class that acts as a registry for all
the applets in the runtime environment. If the registry is implemented
as an observable,
